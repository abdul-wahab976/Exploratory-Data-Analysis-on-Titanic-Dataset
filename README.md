# Task 2 - Exploratory Data Analysis on Titanic Dataset
**Internship Track:** Data Analytics — Elevvo Pathways

## 🎯 Objective
Perform EDA on the Titanic dataset to analyze survival rates and discover insights based on class, gender, and age.

## 📂 Dataset
- Source: [Kaggle Titanic Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data)
- File: `train.csv`

## 🧹 Data Cleaning
- Handled missing values in Age and Embarked
- Dropped Cabin (too many missing values)
- Converted categorical columns

## 📊 Visualizations
- Survival by Gender (bar chart)
- Survival by Passenger Class (bar chart)
- Age Distribution by Survival
- Heatmap of feature correlations

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Seaborn & Matplotlib

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Women had higher survival rates
- 1st-class passengers survived more than 3rd-class
- Younger passengers had slightly better survival chances

## 📤 Deliverables
- Cleaned dataset
- Jupyter Notebook
- Screenshots of charts
